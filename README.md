# Imagenette Classification

A image classification model for the Imagenette ([Imagenette dataset](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette)) dataset. At the 526th epoch, we achieved an accuracy of 94.5223%.

```Training Model.py``` are codes for training our model. Before running the codes, you need to first download the Imagenette dataset ([Imagenette dataset](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette)), download and install Ranger optimizer ([Ranger optimizer](https://github.com/lessw2020/Ranger-Deep-Learning-Optimizer)), and change the paths in the codes into your corresponding local path.

```Testing Model.py``` are codes for testing our model. Before running the codes, you need to first download the Imagenette dataset ([Imagenette dataset](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette)), and change the paths in the codes into your corresponding local path.

```ResNet18 0.945223.pth``` are the parameters of our model.
